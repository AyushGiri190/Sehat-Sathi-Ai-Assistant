    { question: "What types of X-rays can I upload?", answer: "You can upload X-rays of the chest, brain, lungs, and tuberculosis screening. Other scans are a work in progress, and we are continuously improving our model to support more types of medical imaging in the future. Stay tuned for updates!" },
